Select, Group By and Arrange Functions (3.2): These functions will all be useful to sort through data to get a better understanding of what you are looking at both in terms of a semantic categorization of data, and in the extremity of the observations.

Filter Functions (4.2): Similarly to Slect Group By and Arrange Functions, the Filter functions will and have helped navigate messier data sets toward the information / observations / data of interest.
 
Join Functions (3.2): All of the join functions have been and will continue to be particularly useful. I still have difficulty distinguishing between them however they are the central method to combine separate dataframes.

Mutate Functions (3.2): These change the observations of entire variable columns, which has been and will be very useful in standardizing dataframes, and creating new variables for more succinct analysis.
